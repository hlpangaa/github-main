### Projects

---

#### Blockchain

---

**dApp for NFT Ticketing** (https://github.com/hlpangaa/nft-ticketing-main)

- Deployed smart contracts in Ethereum network using hardhat framework, utilized a Next JS frontend to allow user to use Metamask to interact with the smart contract in a Web3 fashsion
- Hosted the frontend in Fleek(decentralized nodes) and connected with theGraph(indexing protocal) to listen the event emitted under the contracts, stored metadata in InterPlanetary File System(IPFS)

#### Data Scraping

---

**Flight Price Alert** (https://github.com/hlpangaa/python-web-scraping)

- Programed to harvest flight price data from Expedia and Skyscanner using Beautiful soup and Selenium, scheduled to run daily with Macbook's built-in job automater.
- Cleaned, normalized, and transformed the raw data into usable information in Pandas and Numpy, designed a alert trigger when the expected price is hitted.

#### Data Fetching

---

**Foodie Portal** (https://github.com/hlpangaa/react-foodie-data-fetching)

- Built a React-based portal to allow users to view random food recipes or search sepcific type of food and feedback
- Setup API integration with themealdb to the responsive single page application

**Trader's Watchlist** (https://github.com/hlpangaa/react-trading-data-fetching)

- Built a React-based portal to allow users to view trading data in own's watchlist via FinnHub API
- Visualized the candle chart for the stock and introduced Auto-complete function in the stock list

#### Data Pipeline

---

**F1(Car Racing) Data Pipeline** (https://github.com/hlpangaa/databrick-formula1-data)

- Constructed a data pipeline for F1 data in Azure environment with components of Azure data lake storage, Azure data factory and Databrick
- Transformed and Load the data using Python and SQL to convert a single csv to multiple tables with defined schema and partition

#### Machine Learning

---

##### Supervised Learning

**Used Car Price Prediction** (https://github.com/hlpangaa/python-ml-linear-regression)

- Gathered and analyzed data related to used car prices and divided the data into training and testing datasets
- Built a linear regression model, evaluated the model using Mean Squared Error(MSE) and predicted the used car price

**Classfication for Loan Evaluation** (https://github.com/hlpangaa/python-ml-decision-tree-and-random-forest-loan-data)

- Gathered and analyzed data related to automobile loan and divided the data into training and testing datasets
- Constructed a decision tree via computing the information gain recursively , improved the model performance using Random Forest Algorithms(RFA), and predicted the loan status (Approved/Declined)

##### Unsupervised Learning

**Clustering to group Loan Applications** (https://github.com/hlpangaa/python-ml-kmean-and-clustering-loan-data)

- Gathered and analyzed data related to automobile loan application and divided the data into training and testing datasets
- Applied K-means and Hierarchical Clustering, evaluated the model and generated the clustering results.

##### Reinforcement Learning

**Robot Cleaning** (https://github.com/hlpangaa/python-ml-reinforement-learning-robot-cleaner)

- Created a learning environment, a robot agent and a reward function and applied reinforcement learning algorithm to enable the robot to learn
- Visualized the Robot Behavior and evaluated the result via a plotted graph for rewards aginst the number of testing episode
